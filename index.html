      <h1>Being and Becoming: Reconceptualizing Childhood and Children Agency</h1>
      </div>

      <div id="discrip">
        <p>Over the past decades, children and childhood had many different conceptualizations arguing their contribution and the agency they have in the word and in particular in the contemporary participatory culture. Children or childhood as beings and becomings are two different conflicting approaches affect the social attitude and beliefs toward children allowed activity and role in the physical and virtual societies. The becoming children debates define children as an ‚Äúadult in making‚Äù who is waiting to become and grow to the capable adult that have the ability, fitness, or quality necessary to do or achieve tasks. In this context, children are vulnerable, immature, and dependent therefore, unable to have the full citizen status and rights and should serve as a reflection of the adult they will be in the future.
          In contrast, the being child debates argue children as full social actor who are capable and own their right to construct and perform as an integral member of the society. Therefore, children have the capacity and empowered to form social relationships and cultural activities that are equally treated to the adults.
         </p>


    <p>
      Keeping the being and becoming notions in mind, a third conceptualization emerge that consider these discourses together not as conflicting discourses, but as ones that complement one another. Therefore, consider children as both being and becoming increases their agency as social member online and offline. This project is dedicated to support this combination notion integrating children as active social agent who should have well defined and known contribution in the knowledge constructions and cultural experience, therefore their agency increases and value in present and future. Thus, Being and Becoming reconceptualizing childhood and children of becoming adult based on their present being agent and contribution to their future adult and to the social and cultural work they interact currently with.
